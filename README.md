# Jap
This is a self-teaching tool for people who want to learn Japanese. I am thinking of something like what I used to get in primary school:
  
  The teacher will read the word every time you learn some new ones, and you have to write them down. Then you will be graded based on how 
  many you got correct. This step is just to help you memorise the words, how to write them down and how to pronounce them. As for how to 
  use the words correctly, I think I will put it in the second phase.

The application, hopefully, will be an executable programme on windows first and transfer to android afterwards. I am still in the designing phase.

On a second thought, I decided to build it as a web application first. With angular as front end and java as back end. I would use Spring and Hibernate to help me build it. The front end part will come out first, with no back end logic attached to it (just fixed string values or dummy data to show the UI/UX).

Functional requirement will come later, and will be updated as the development is in progress. That's all.
