# Jap
This is a self-teaching tool for people who want to learn Japanese. I am thinking of something like what I used to get in primary school:
  
  The teacher will read the word every time you learn some new ones, and you have to write them down. Then you will be graded based on how 
  many you got correct. This step is just to help you memorise the words, how to write them down and how to pronounce them. As for how to 
  use the words correctly, I think I will put it in the second phase.

The application, hopefully, will be an executable programme on windows first and transfer to android afterwards. I am still in the designing phase.
That's all.
